\chapter{Introduction}

This thesis explores integer linear programming through the lens of linear Diophantine equations.

Let us consider the feasibility problem:
\[
\text{Find } x \in \Z_{\geq 0}^n \text{ such that } Ax \leq b.
\]

We analyze its structure, derive bounds, and explore algorithmic solutions.
